# Winter-Fractals-CG-Project
Monochromatic CG fractals project. 
This is my portion of the group project found at https://github.com/enondorf934/computer-graphics-project (held here for portfolio purposes).

To build, go to the root directory (where the build.gradle file is located) and run "gradle installDist", then navigate to 
.../computer-graphics-project-fractals/build/install/computer-graphics-project-fractals/bin/ for the appropriate executable/batch file
for your machine.
